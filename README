The ASPIC program for processing line drawings
----------------------------------------------

Copyright (c) 2022 University of Cambridge

I hope that this version of the program will run without problems on all Unix 
and Unix-like systems. It should just be a matter of typing

./configure
make
make install

to get youself an installed aspic command. There is a man page that lists the
command arguments. However, the main documentation is provided only as a PDF
file in the doc directory.
