Change Log for Aspic
--------------------

Version 2.01  xx January 2023
-----------------------------

1. Fix memory overrun when processing unterminated string.

2. Detects and give error for overlong variable name in substitution.


Version 2.00  15 October 2022
-----------------------------

Time for a spring clean of this very old code.

1. Fix warnings from current compiler checks.

2. Remove obsolete SGCAL support.

3. Remove obsolete 16-bit architecture support.

4. Remove obsolete SunOS4 support for missing div_t etc.

5. Refactor memory handling - fewer calls to malloc() and ensure everying is
   freed.

6. Add support for coloured text in SVG output (it already existed for EPS).

7. Improve the heuristic for calculating the bounding box of a string.

8. Add support for Bezier curve items, but no arrows.

9. Remove obsolete/redundant "is font loaded" check in PostScript output.

10. Add support for rotated text strings.

11. Avoid closing stdin or stdout.

12. Change default output to .eps or .svg if a named input file but no output 
given.

13. Give error for text option consisting just one number if it contains a 
decimal point, as it is supposed to be a font number.

14. Add support for bounding frame thickness, colour, fill, dashedness.

15. With the help of LCOV, extend the tests to improve their coverage.

16. General code tidying throughout, without affecting behaviour, for example 
moving some declarations into "for" loops and adding/extending comments.


Version 1.05  04 March 2008
---------------------------

 1. Tidied Makefile so that it shows only a short line for each compiled file.

 2. Added the -testing feature to avoid the version identification in the PS
    and SVG output, thus making it easier to maintain the tests.

 3. Text strings associated with non-horizontal lines are moved 3 points to
    the right by default - they were hitting vertical lines. Text strings
    associated with arcs are moved 6 points to the right by default for the
    same reason.

 4. When computing the bounding box of a picture, a rough guess at the size of
    a string is now made, in order to take into account strings that stick out
    out of the sides of a picture. Previously, strings were ignored when
    computing bounding boxes, leading to very bad values in some cases.
    However, since Aspic doesn't actually process strings, the new code is just
    a heuristic guess, though it seems to do a reasonable job.

 5. SVG output was not including strings associated with invisible lines.

 6. Improve vertical positioning of multiple strings when fonts of sizes
    other than the default 12 points are used. The "textdepth" and "fontdepth"
    parameters are now minima. When multiple lines of text are printed, if the
    font size is greater than the textdepth setting, the larger size is used.
    Similarly, if half the font size is greater than the fontdepth setting, it
    is used. This is all heuristical, since Aspic doesn't really process text.

 7. Fix some uninitialized values bugs (found by valgrind).

 8. Change string character handling to recognize UTF-8 characters and
    encodings using the &...; mechanism.

 9. Add the -tr option to translate quotes and en-dashes.


Version 1.04  20 January 2008
-----------------------------

 1. Fixed a bug that caused invisible boxes and ellipses not to be filled if
    a filling colour was defined. I think the fix for 1.01 below broke it.


Version 1.03  09 January 2008
-----------------------------

 1. Fixed a bug that caused the wrong colour to be used in PostScript output in
    certain cases for items following an arrow that was associated with
    coloured text.


Version 1.02  26 September 2007
-------------------------------

 1. Added the "include" facility.

 2. The "level" facility wasn't working properly for PostScript output.

 3. Add the ability to colour text.


Version 1.01  06 June 2007
--------------------------

 1. PostScript output was going wrong for invisible boxes and lines that had
    attached text strings.


Version 1.00  28 December 2004
------------------------------

 1. Added the "redraw" facility for use with SGCAL and sgpoint.


Version 0.09  15 December 2004
------------------------------

 1. Separated Aspic from the SGCAL command bundle and made it freestanding.
    Abolished the separate configuration file, and instead implemented three
    separate output modules for PostScript, SVG, and SGCAL output. Revised the
    command interface.
